Input these keys to launch or ask for help about algorithms:
bf - Brute force
sh - Simple (linear) hash
qh - Quadratic hash
rk - Rabin-Karp algorithm
auto - Finite deterministic automat
mp - Morris-Pratt algorithm

After launching algorithm, you should enter fragments and select text.
You will be able to input new data immediately after starting algorithm, because it's launched in parallel thread.
